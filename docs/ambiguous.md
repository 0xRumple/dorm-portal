* officer of dorm is the manager ? **yes**

* add contact dorm info in confirm payment page ? **yes**

* compare two dorms by price? **no**

    by room or by dorm?

    how should it be like?

    show only two prices?
	
* why academic year? **part of the filters(radio summer, fall, spring, full year)**

	we only show avaiable rooms

* date range of each room characteristics

	should the manager put 4 different pricing (summer, fall...) ? **no**

* send email when contract finishes **no**

  how can I know if students exist in dormitory? (system only reserving & confirm payments... not management system)

	we can add a non-useful ending reservation field

	but it's simply non-useful

* airport transport information ? **no need**

* if two students send payment for one last room **use deadline payment for that**

	we can't reserve the room without confirmation => only decrease the qouta once confirmed payment

	what should happen?

	can we prevent this?
	
* why showing deadline for payment? **answered above**

	either he pays or not
	
* discount dorms **no need**

	based on what?

* tl usd show both ? **allow to convert prices dynamically when searching BUT show only one price when payment request shows**

    how should the price be affected ?

    we can't exchange by ourselves

    the manager should update the price manually, and TL is very volatile

* many prices show on the slider ? **to be discussed**

    suppose we have 40 room types.. showing them all would be on top of each others !

    is that ok ?

* can student upload another receipt or delete the previous one ? **he can add as many as he wants**

    this means the previous one would be overwrited, right ?

    should we keep all of them ? (bloated system) !

* why multiple steps search ? **no need**

    how ?

    isnt is better UX to just filter once ?
