* officer of dorm is the manager ?

* add contact dorm info in confirm payment page ?

* compare two dorms by price?

  by room or by dorm?

  how should it be like?

  show only two prices?

* private + public campus filter

	is it really important?

	doesn't that affect other dorms business?
	
* why academic year?

	we only show avaiable rooms

* date range of each room characteristics

	should the manager put 4 different pricing (summer, fall...) ?

* send email when contract finishes

  how can I know if students exist in dormitory? (system only reserving & confirm payments... not management system)

	we can add a non-useful ending reservation field

	but it's simply non-useful

* airport transport information ?

* if two students send payment for one last room

	we can't reserve the room without confirmation => only decrease the qouta once confirmed payment

	what should happen?

	can we prevent this?
	
* why showing deadline for payment?

	either he pays or not
	
* discount dorms

	based on what?
